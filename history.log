[ðŸ’¡] To list all files inside a specific directory, you can use the `ls` command followed by the path to the directory you want to list the files from.

Step by step:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Use the following command to list all files inside a specific directory:
   
   ```bash
   ls /path/to/directory
   ```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path of the directory you want to list the files from.
